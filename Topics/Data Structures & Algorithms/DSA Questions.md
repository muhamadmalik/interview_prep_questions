23. You have 8 balls, 7 of them have the same weight while 1 is heavier than the rest. What is the min # of tries to find the heavier ball with a weighing balance (Note: not weighing scale)? _Answer: 2_


**Some more comprehensive or challenging questions were:**

1. You have 5 cans with a total water capacity of t=[3,5,3,5,5]. These cans already have some water represented by used=[3,2,2,2,2]. What is the minimum number of cans required to fill the already available water? _hint: greedy approach_
2. There are 4 squadrons marching in different areas of the city. They can only move up,down,left or right. They are required by the commander to meet at one place everyday. Find the mid-point such that the total distance from those 4 squadrons (4 points) to that mid-point is minimum. _hint: greedy approach_
