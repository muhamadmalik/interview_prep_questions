Every year thousands of computer science graduates are on a hunt for their first job. When I was looking for my first job and preparing for my technical interviews I tried to practice almost everything, usually the more advanced concepts. However, what I failed to realize was that sometimes we focus too much on the difficult concepts and don't practice the easy/moderate stuff which sometimes tends to be counterproductive.

If you're preparing for a technical interview, the most important thing is PRACTICE. You can't ace a technical interview even if you know all the concepts, and fail to translate that into working code.

There are a ton of resources available on the internet for interview preparation, but I felt sometimes our people don't have an idea related to what kind of questions are asked by Pakistani tech companies during interviews. My aim is not to discourage people from rigorous interview prep, but to make them aware that interviews aren't as difficult as they think.

I have been interviewed by companies including Arbisoft, Tintash, 7Vals, folio3, Ebryx, Cloudplex, ProCheck and more.

**Here's a list of common questions I've been asked:**

1. Reverse a singly linked list (both iteratively and recursively)
2. How would you detect a loop in a singly linked List?
3. Swap 2 variables without using another variable.
4. What is the Diamond Problem? _hint: virtual inheritance_
5. Common Object Oriented programming questions related to inheritance, composition, polymorphsim (compile-time vs run-time) , aggregation, association, function overloading, function overriding and more.
6. How will you implement a class in c++ which will have only **one** instance? (Singleton Design Pattern) _hint: private constructor_
7. How to detect first duplicate in the given array a=[8,2,4,6,1,8,5] in O(n)? _hint: hash table_
8. How would you sort an array in O(n), don't worry about space complexity? _hint: hash table_
9. You have 8 balls, 7 of them have the same weight while 1 is heavier than the rest. What is the min # of tries to find the heavier ball with a weighing balance (Note: not weighing scale)? _Answer: 2_
10. Write an SQL query to find 2nd highest salary in the given table.
11. Common JavaScript questions related to closures, hoisting, const vs let vs var, and more.

**Some more comprehensive or challenging questions were:**

1. You have 5 cans with a total water capacity of t=[3,5,3,5,5]. These cans already have some water represented by used=[3,2,2,2,2]. What is the minimum number of cans required to fill the already available water? _hint: greedy approach_
2. There are 4 squadrons marching in different areas of the city. They can only move up,down,left or right. They are required by the commander to meet at one place everyday. Find the mid-point such that the total distance from those 4 squadrons (4 points) to that mid-point is minimum. _hint: greedy approach_
3. Design and code an email system in any programming language you're comfortable with, using object oriented principles.
