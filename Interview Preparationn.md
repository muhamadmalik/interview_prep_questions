- 15 Manufacturers produce 27 balls in 1 hour. How many balls will 45 manufacturers make in 40 minutes? (Direct Proportion: 45/15 * 27 * (40/60) = 3 * 27 * 2/3 = 54 balls)
    
- Two ropes, each takes 1 hour to burn completely (can burn from both ends). Measure exactly 45 minutes? (Burn rope A from both ends, rope B from one. A burns in 30 min. Light other end of B. B burns remaining half in 15 min. Total 30+15=45) x2
    
- 3 containers with wrong tags (e.g., Apples, Oranges, Mixed). You can check only one fruit from one container. Make tags correct? (Pick from 'Mixed'. If Apple, that's Apple box. Box labelled 'Apple' must be Orange, box labelled 'Orange' must be Mixed.) x2

Return 15 wrap -> 5 candies + 5 wrappers. Return 3 wrap -> 1 candy + 1 wrapper + 2 leftover. Return 3 wrap (1+2) -> 1 candy + 1 wrapper. Total = 15+5+1+1 = 22 candies) x2
    
- Divide a cake into 8 equal pieces in 3 cuts? (Cut +, then cut horizontally through middle) x2

Put halves from one tablet in pile 1, halves from second in pile 2 etc. Each day take one half from each of the 4 piles. Guarantees 1A, 1B if done correctly, maybe split each day's dose?) Alternative interpretation: Eat 2 tablets, one of each type, TODAY. -> (Break all 4 into halves. Take one half from each original tablet. Total = 4 halves = 2 full tablets, guaranteed one of each type).
    
- Time is 3:15, angle between minute and hour needle? (Hour hand: 330 + 15(0.5) = 90 + 7.5 = 97.5 deg. Minute hand: 15*6 = 90 deg. Angle = 97.5 - 90 = 7.5 degrees)

(Trains collide in 160 / (80+80) = 1 hour. Bird flies for 1 hour. Distance = 70 * 1 = 70 km) x2 (Variation: Speeds 200 each, dist 400, bird 393.75 -> collide time = 400/400 = 1 hr. Bird dist = 393.75 km. Variation: Dist 200km -> collide time = 200/400 = 0.5 hr. Bird dist = 393.75 * 0.5 = 196.875 km)
    
- Label 3 wrongly labeled bags (Red balls, Black balls, Mixed) in 1 try (pick 1 ball from one bag)? (Pick from bag labelled 'Mixed'. If Red -> that bag is Red, bag labelled 'Red' is Black, bag labelled 'Black' is Mixed. Similar logic if Black is picked.) x2
    
- Max count of numbers having increasing order subsequence? (e.g., 1 3 6, 2, 5, 0 -> max count is 3 for 1 3 6. e.g., 2 2 2 2 -> max count is 1) (Find length of longest increasing subsequence)

- Two candles, burn in 60 min from one end, 30 min from both. Measure 45 min? (Light candle A both ends, candle B one end. A burns in 30 min. Light other end of B. B burns remaining half in 15 min. Total 30+15 = 45 min) x2

- 2 blue pills, 2 red pills. Blind man has to eat one of each (1B, 1R) daily (one morning, one night). How? (Break all 4 pills in half. Take one half from each of the 4 original pills each day. Guarantees 1B, 1R daily dose split into morning/night halves).

Candidate A got 75% of valid votes OR 75% of total votes cast for them were valid? Assuming 75% of valid votes: 0.75 * 476000 = 357,000. Assuming A got 75% of total votes AND those votes were valid: 0.75 * 560000 = 420,000. Question is ambiguous. The link implies 75% of valid.) x2
    
- Probability: Cards 1-20. Draw one random. Probability it's multiple of 3 AND 5? (Multiple of 15 -> only 15. P = 1/20)

- Sand timers: 7 min and 11 min. Measure 15 min? (Start both. When 7min ends, flip 7min. When 11min ends, flip 11min. When 7min ends 2nd time (at 14min total), flip 11min again. It had 3 min left, flipping runs it for 1 more min. Total 14+1=15) x2
