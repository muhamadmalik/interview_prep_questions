My name is Muhamad Bashir, and I am a recent Software Engineering graduate from the Islamia University of Bahawalpur.
I recently completed a 4-month internship as a MERN Stack Developer at LatencySoft, where I was responsible for developing and maintaining RESTful APIs using Node.js and Express, and building responsive front-end components with React.

During my final semesters, I focused heavily on sharpening my skills through hands-on projects and consistent practice. I have built several full-stack web applications, including:


In addition to web development, I have a strong grasp of Python and have actively worked on solving Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems to strengthen my logical and problem-solving skills.


My final year project was a blog site where authors could sign up, write and manage articles, add tags, and interact with readers through comments. It included features like author profiles, tag-based filtering, and a clean admin interface for moderation. The goal was to create a fully functional content publishing platform from scratch.


I faced a challenge in handling many-to-many relationships between articles and tags.
I solved it by designing a proper relational schema using a junction table and writing custom queries to efficiently manage tag associations.




**1. Tell me about yourself.**  
My name is Muhamad Malik, and I’m a recent Software Engineering graduate from the Islamia University of Bahawalpur. I recently completed a 4-month internship as a MERN Stack Developer at LatencySoft, where I worked on building RESTful APIs using Node.js and Express, and creating responsive front-end components in React.  
During my last semesters, I focused on sharpening my skills by building full-stack projects and solving DSA problems in Python. I’m very passionate about web development and aim to become a computer architect in the future.

**2. Why did you choose Software Engineering?**  
I've always been curious about how software systems work and how technology solves real-world problems. When I explored coding during my early semesters, I realized I really enjoy building things and solving logic-based challenges, so Software Engineering felt like the perfect fit.

---

**3. Where do you see yourself in 3–5 years?**  
In the next few years, I see myself becoming a more skilled full-stack developer with deeper system-level knowledge. My long-term goal is to move into computer architecture or system design, working on building high-performance software solutions.

---

**4. What are your strengths and weaknesses?**  
One of my strengths is that I’m a quick learner—I pick up new tools and concepts fast. I’m also detail-oriented, especially when it comes to debugging and solving complex issues.  
As for my weakness, I sometimes spend too much time trying to perfect things, but I’m learning to balance quality with deadlines better.

---

**5. Why should we hire you?**  
I have a solid foundation in full-stack development and hands-on project experience. I’m very motivated to learn, contribute, and grow in a professional environment. I’ve worked hard to build real projects and solve practical problems, and I believe I’ll bring that same energy and responsibility to your team.

---

**6. Why do you want to work here / in this role?**  
I’m excited about working in an environment where I can keep learning and apply my skills to real-world challenges. I read about your company’s projects, and I feel they align with what I want to do and grow into. This role feels like the right opportunity for me to start my professional journey.

**7. Tell me about a project you’re proud of.**  
One of the projects I’m proud of is a blog site I built as my final year project. It included author profiles, article tagging, and commenting. I faced a challenge in handling many-to-many relationships between articles and tags, and I solved it by designing a proper relational schema using a junction table and writing custom queries.

---

**8. What was the most difficult bug or issue you faced in a project?**  
While building a service marketplace platform, I had trouble handling booking conflicts between service providers. Users were sometimes able to double-book the same time slots. I solved this by implementing a proper slot-checking system on the backend that validates availability before confirming any booking.

---

**9. How do you handle deadlines or multiple tasks?**  
I usually break big tasks into smaller milestones and use tools like Notion or Trello to stay organized. I also prioritize my work based on deadlines and dependencies. It helps me stay on track without feeling overwhelmed.

---

**10. Did you work in a team on any of your projects? How was that experience?**  
Yes, during my internship, I worked with a team of developers. We used Git for version control and communicated through daily stand-ups. I learned a lot about collaborating, dividing responsibilities, and solving merge conflicts or misunderstandings respectfully and quickly.

---

**11. Tell me about a time when you failed or made a mistake. What did you learn?**  
Once, I deployed an update to a project without properly testing a new API route, and it caused a bug on the client side. I learned the importance of having a proper testing and deployment workflow, and now I always test everything in staging before pushing to production.

---

**12. How do you handle feedback?**  
I welcome feedback—it helps me grow. During my internship, I got feedback on writing cleaner code and breaking components down into smaller parts, and I applied that right away. I believe feedback helps you see blind spots and improve quickly.

---

**13. How do you stay motivated when you're stuck on a problem?**  
If I’m stuck, I take a short break or explain the problem out loud—it helps me think clearly. I also search documentation or ask for help when needed. Solving problems gives me a sense of accomplishment, so that keeps me going.
