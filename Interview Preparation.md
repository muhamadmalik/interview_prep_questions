Got details.

*Pros*
• Very well known company in terms of skilled people, since they have really good training system. When someone leaves Abacus and applies somewhere else, they often are not interviewed much since they trust that someone experiences from Abacus will surely be of great skillset.
• Extreme level of hard work is needed and becomes tough at times (but that's what's great). Because they really push the person to the best to train him. If you feel like giving up, don't! There will always be a team to support you, and the tough environment will be worth it.
• Good increments.
• Spend 1 or 2 years atleast and don't miss the opportunity, since "Abacus" developers are well known in market.

*Cons*
• Growth is comparatively slow in terms of position (not in terms of salary though).

QUESTIONS	SOLUTION																								
																									
"Q1) array A consisting of N integers is given. A slice of that array is a pair of integers (P, Q) such that 0 ≤ P ≤ Q < N. A slice (P, Q) of an array A is called non-negative if all the elements A[P], A[P+1], ..., A[Q−1], A[Q] are non-negative. The sum of a slice (P, Q) of array A is the value A[P] + A[P+1] + ... + A[Q−1] + A[Q]. For example, the following array A: A[0] = 1 A[1] = 2 A[2] = -3 A[3] = 4 A[4] = 5 A[5] = -6 has non-negative slices (0, 0), (1, 1), (0, 1), (3, 3), (4, 4) and (3, 4). The sum of slice (0, 1) is A[0] + A[1] = 1 + 2 = 3. The sum of slice (3, 4) is A[3] + A[4] = 4 + 5 = 9. The sum of slice (4, 4) is A[4] = 5. 

  You are given an implementation of a function: def solution(A) that, given an array A consisting of N integers, returns the maximum sum of any non-negative slice in this array. The function returns −1 if there are no non-negative slices in the array. For example, given the following array A: A[0] = 1 A[1] = 2 A[2] = -3 A[3] = 4 A[4] = 5 A[5] = -6 the function should return 9, as explained above.     

        The attached code is still incorrect for some inputs. Despite the error(s), the code may produce a correct answer for the example test cases. The goal of the exercise is to find and fix the bug(s) in the implementation. You can modify at most three lines. Assume that: N is an integer within the range [0..1,000]; each element of array A is an integer within the range [−1,000..1,000]. In your solution, focus on correctness. Code is given below..
"																									
																									
"def solution(S):
    max_sum = 0
    current_sum = 0
    positive = False
    n = len(S)
    for i in range(n):
        item = S[i]
        if item < 0:
            if max_sum < current_sum:
                max_sum = current_sum
                current_sum = 0
        else:
            positive = True
            current_sum += item
    if (current_sum > max_sum):
        max_sum = current_sum
    if (positive):
        return max_sum
    return -1"																									
																									
																									
"Q2) 

We will call a sequence of integers a spike if they first increase (strictly) and then decrease (also strictly, including the last element of the increasing part). For example (4, 5, 7, 6, 3, 2) is a spike, but (1, 1, 5, 4, 3) and (1, 4, 3, 5) are not. Note that the increasing and decreasing parts always intersect, e.g.: for spike (3, 5, 2) sequence (3, 5) is an increasing part and sequence (5, 2) is a decreasing part, and for spike (2) sequence (2) is both an increasing and a decreasing part. Your are given an array A of N integers.

Your task is to calculate the length of the longest possible spike, which can be created from numbers from array A. Note that you are NOT supposed to find the longest spike as a sub-sequence of A, but rather choose some numbers from A and reorder them to create the longest spike. Write a function: def solution(A) which, given an array A of integers of length N, returns the length of the longest spike which can be created from the numbers from A. Examples: 1. Given A = [1, 2], your  function should return 2, because (1, 2) is already a spike. 2. Given A = [2, 5, 3, 2, 4, 1], your function should return 6, because we can create the following spike of length 6: (2, 4, 5, 3, 2, 1). 3. Given A = [2, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1], your function should return 4, because we can create the following spike of length 4: (2, 3, 2, 1) and we cannot create any longer spike. Note that increasing and decreasing parts should be strictly increasing/decreasing and they always intersect. Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions: N is an integer within the range [1..100,000]; each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..1,000,000]."	"And this is the solution of the q2 which I created in the test: 

def Solution(A):
        size = len(A)
        
        max_element = -1
        
        if size < 3:
                return 2;
        
        for i in range(size):
                if A[i] > max_element:
                        max_element = A[i]
        
        frequency = {}

"- Abstraction and interface 
"	Both are use as blueprint.In abstraction we have abstract class and inside abstract class we can difine abstract methods which can be accessed in drive class. we  can't make properties in interface. we cannot make object of interface as we can not make object of abstract class. in absctract we have to minimum one method abstract but in interface we have to abststact all methods.		- Transitive Dependency			- Delete middle node of linked List.			- Design patterns 			one candy costs one rupees. if you return three wrappers, you'll get an extra candy. how many candies you get for 15 rupees			- Swap two integers without using 3rd variable		
- Static are overloaded or overridden 	A static can be method or variable. A self key world is use for if you want to acces static variable in class.

- Final are overloaded or overridden	"overloaded but can not overidden. The final keyword is a non-access modifier used for classes, attributes and methods, which makes them non-changeable (impossible to inherit or override).

The final keyword is useful when you want a variable to always store the same value, like PI (3.14159...).

The final keyword is called a ""modifier""."		normalization			- Inorder Recursion traversal Code						You have 4 tablets, 2 of one type and 2 of other, your task is to eat 2 tablets of one type each.

Q1: shape is a parent class square and circle are child classes
Shape *sh=new Circle() ;
Is it valid statement? And explain why?

Q2: what is Singleton design pattern and how do we implement it?

Q3: Explain Observer design pattern

Q4: what is denormalization and what are its advantages?

Q5: A customer paid a bill by checkingout on website. He is your website customer. And the status of payment become paid. There is no difficulty in the process. How to maintain data Integrity.

Q6 write a query to display product name and category name where product ID is 1. Tables name are Product, Category and Product Category

Q7: Design database of university its primary keys foreign keys of student, teachers and courses and also write usecases

Q8: print 2dimensional array of NxN size using one loop and one variable

Q9: Given an array of five positive integers. Calculate the mininum and maximum sum of 4 out of 5 integers. Calculate this in minimum time complexity

Q10: replace a digit in a number without using string or character typecasting
Example input=replace(423567,6,0)
Output=423507

*Solutions* :

1st :
The pointer
Shape * s = new Circle();
As you already mentioned, s is a pointer-to-Shape in this case. The statement declares s, and assigns a pointer of type Circle to it. This implies that Circle is derived from Shape.

Because C++ is a polymorphic language, s does now point to an object of type Circle. If Shape has virtual functions that are overloaded by Circle, calls to those functions on s will be redirected to the overloading Circle implementation.


2nd:
The singleton pattern is a design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one object.

3rd:
The Publish/Subscribe pattern, also known as pub/sub, is an architectural design pattern that provides a framework for exchanging messages between publishers and subscribers. This pattern involves the publisher and the subscriber relying on a message broker that relays messages from the publisher to the subscribers.

4th:
Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database. This includes creating tables and establishing relationships between those tables according to rules designed both to protect the data and to make the database more flexible by eliminating redundancy and inconsistent dependency.

Benefits of Data Normalization
Reduces redundant data.
Provides data consistency within the database.
More flexible database design.
Higher database security.
Better and quicker execution.
Greater overall database organization.

7th: sql injection attack:
SQL injection (SQLi) is a cyberattack that injects malicious SQL code into an application, allowing the attacker to view or modify a database.
A successful SQL injection attack can result in unauthorized access to sensitive data, such as passwords, credit card details, or personal user information.

How to Prevent SQL Injection
Use Stored Procedure, Not Dynamic SQL.
Input Validation


10.for(int i = 0; i < rows * columns; i++)

{
int row = i / columns;
int col = i % columns;
cout << arr[row][col] << " ";

}


12. int replaceDigit(int x, int d1, int d2)
{

int result = 0, multiply = 1;

while (x / 10 > 0) {

// Take remainder of number starting from the unit

// place digit

int remainder = x % 10;

// check whether it is equal to the digit to be

// replaced.if yes then replace

if (remainder == d1)

result = result + d2 * multiply;

else // else remain as such

result = result + remainder * multiply;

// Update and move forward from unit place to

// hundred place and so on.

multiply *= 10;

x = x / 10; // update the value

}

// check whether it is equal to the digit to be

// replaced.if yes then replace

if (x == d1)

result = result + d2 * multiply;

else // else remain as such

result = result + x * multiply;

return result;

OOP		DB		DSA		Analytical		
Solid Principals		ACID		There were three coding problems. Have to do code in Google docs file which is shared by screen with Him.		Ratio k 2 3 atay bus logical e.g, 30 workers 15 days me 1 kaam complete kr rhy to 15 workers kitne din me kreinge etc etc.		
Pillars of oop		Synchronization						
Abstract vs interface		Mutex Lock (OS). How used in db. And also give a real world example apart from coding.		1. Two arrays a and b. a is subset of b. there's only one element that is not in a but in b. Find that element.				
Can abstract class extend single or multiple abstract classes?				Arrays are not sorted.				
Real world examples of objects, OOP and four pillars				He asked in all cases. O(n2) , nlgn and O(n)				
								
				2. Maximum sub array problem to find maximum sum.				
								
				3. Rotation of linkedlist in o(k). Do rotation even if the index is greater. Keep repeating it.				
								
				Language doesn't matter. Do puesdo code and dry run and explain.

Instructions
1. Test time: 1 hour (Starting from the time of your booking (not the time of your
joining the room).
2. Join the meeting room with your correct name, otherwise we won’t know who
you are.
3. You should use Javascript only. If you face any IDE issues, you can simply use
the browser's console in dev tools.
4. Share your “full screen”. Not just a tab or application but “full desktop”.
5. Do not turn off screen share at any point.
6. You can use vscode or IDE for code hinting. You are not allowed to use google
or any other search engine or external source.
7. Your screen will be recorded. If you do anything contrary, you may get
disqualified.
8. You do not need to submit the answers anywhere. We will observe the
recording of your screen to assess.
9. You can leave the meeting room once you have completed the test. The
interviewer may auto exit/part you if time is over. Do not be surprised.
10. You are not supposed to ask any questions from the interviewer about test. If
some is unclear, you should figure it out. If something is incorrect in the question,
you can report it to the whatsapp number you got the invitation from.
Questions
11. 60 - Algo - 25 -
Given an input parameter of a string, find characters that are not repeated more than
2 times, extract them in the same sequence and return if they are pelendrom. Return
“notfound” if not.
a. E.g
i. input : “abaacbfcb” here ‘a’ and ‘b’ are repeated more than 2 times. So
we will ignore them. However, ‘c’ ‘f’ ‘c’ are not repeated more than 2
times. We will extract them in the sequence and order of the string as
“cfc” because it is also a palindrome. So you should return “cfc” as a
string.
ii. input parameter string: “psxxxszzzpz”. Here “pssp” is the correct answer.
b. Tests: Write a function named penTwoTimes(s);
Print it in console.log(penTowTimes(s)) for each of the bellow.
i. If s is “abaacbfcb” - the printed value should be “cfc”
ii. If s is “aaaaaaaa” - the printed value should be “notfound”
iii. If s is “psxxyyyyyxszzzpzyyyy” - the printed value should be “pssp”
I.e do this
console.log(penTowTimes(“abaacbfc
console.log(penTowTimes(“aaaaaaaa”))
console.log(penTowTimes(“psxxyyyyyxszzzpzyyyy”))
c. Constraints:
i. There is only one palindrome in the string provided. You should not seek
for more than one. Get / use the first one you find.
ii. If a character repeats more than 2 times, it should be ignored (like it never
existed in the string).
12. 50 - Algo - 20 -
Write a program that finds and returns missing numbers in an array. There can be any
amount of numbers in any sequence in the array.
a. EXAMPLES - [1,6,3,5,2]. Here [4] is missing. [2,5] here 3 and 4 are missing so
the expected returned array should be [3,4].
b. EXPECTED RESULT: return: array of missing numbers e.g [4] or [2,5]
c. NOTES AND PROVISIONS
i. You can change the input and match the expected output for only these
but your function should be able to handle any input array of any length,
any numbers, and any gaps between numbers in that array of numbers.
ii. It will not have negative numbers.
d. CONSTRAINTS.
i. The returned array should be in ascending order. E.g [3,4,7,9]. Not
[3,5,2,1].
ii. The function name should NOT be changed, else the question will go
wrong. : const myFunction = () => { return [1,2,3] }
e. Tests: test (input, expected output)
Make a function named missing(arr) and print these 5 lines below.
i. test( [1,6,3,5,2] , [4] )
console.log(missing([1,6,3,5,2])) should print [4]
ii. test( [1,7,3,5,2] , [4, 6] )
console.log(missing([1,7,3,5,2] )) should print [4, 6]
iii. test( [2,5] , [3,4] )
console.log(missing([2,5] )) should print [3,4]
iv. test( [5,2] , [3,4] )
console.log(missing([5,2])) should print [3,4]
v. test( [99999997, 99999999] , [99999998] )
console.log(missing([99999997, 99999999]) should print [99999998]
13. 40 - Algo - 20 -
Given an array of undetermined length, find the largest sum possible for any 3
consecutive numbers.
a. E.g:
i. [2,0,1,100,200,10,7,2,300,2,10] here 100,200,10 = 310 is the correct
answer. Here only the combination of these 3 numbers produces the
largest sum.
ii. [2,1,0,20,7] = 0+20+7 = 27 is the answer that you should return.
b. Assumptions:
i. There will always be at least 3 numbers in an array.
c. Constraints:
i. Return a number. Not an array or string. Otherwise your answer may
result to be incorrect
d. Tests: Make a function named largestConsec(arr) and print the 2 lines below
i. [2,0,1,110,200,10,7,2,300,2,10] = 320
console.log(largestConsec([2,0,1,110,200,10,7,2,300,2,10])) should print
320
ii. [2,1,0,20,8] = 28
console.log(largestConsec([2,1,0,20,8] )) should print 28

 Then thore se web based questions because mera fyp web me hai
Like post put get delete kya hote etc
 Get post request kese krte ye sb
 Phr oop questions
 Abstract aur interface me difference
 Polymorphism thore se Bht zada detail me ni
 Then he asked which data structure u like the most i said link list
 Link list vs array 
Phr program to find middle of link list
Agr even nodes ho to konse node middle hogi Odd me konsi
Phr db questions
Indexing query thee bht basic se
Then analytical question ik"



Interface ki implementation Diamond problem ko solve krny k liy
Abstraction or encapsulation m diff
Indexing or uski types detail m
Abstract class vs interfaces
Restful api
Authentication vs authorization
Array ka size 10 hai 11th index pr value kese insert hogi
Array or linkedlist m searching ki time complexity, Agr koi random value search krni hai
Tree m srf aik root node h .. ye BST hai ya ni
Self join ki query
2 3 queries thein
Put patch post m diff
Data structures ki definition
BST ki characteristics

recently aik incident hua jahan haseeb larke k naam hay ushe dusre din hi nikaal diya
"	mujhe offer ki, mene zayada demand ki to kahte email karengein, and then they went ghost mode																				
"Test is divided into three sections:
SQA test, 1 analytical test, 1 personality test
There were many questions in the SQA test including things like:
- test instagram app,  If you were to add a new feature in ABC app, what would you add.... , - Scenario based questions,..... - Problem identification on the question paper

The questions are difficult to explain but I'll try my best.
Q1: Given an integer k and an array, split the array into two parts such that each part's sum equals to k otherwise return -1.
Given a 4x4 matrix
C stands for Charlie (dog)
F for Food
H for home
You need to compute minimum moves for Charlie such that it first eats all the food before going to home
For example [FOOF],[OCOOH],[OOOO],[FOOO]
Amswer is 11.
Q3; You need to compute maximum free time in between the given time slots.
For example
[(8:30AM-10:00AM),(10:30AM-12PM),(12PM-2:30PM)]
The maximum time slot is 30 minutes.

"Assalamualaikum fellows. I hope you're all doing well and doing preparations for interviews too for job hunting.

I am here to share an effective technique to cross check yourself after preparation. Use Chatgpt and make it your interviewer. Give it a prompt that this is the role, these are subjects and this is the experience required. Take my interview. And then try to give answer loudly of those questions. It will give you an insight whether you have fine preparations or not yet.

And apart from this, choose a specific subject. Like I will choose databases. I will ask Chatgpt k Bhai ask me a long list of basic interview questions. Then intermediate then advance. Each time it will give you almost 30+ questions. Try answering them to yourself one by one. If there's any that is not clear to you, ask Chatgpt to give an answer for that question and prepare that. Within a week, you'll feel a way more confident or interviewer k question complete krne se pehle e answer kro ge ap InShaAllah. xD 

+ Must go through the questions of each subject of  interviewbit website. Majority of our questions are covered in their pdfs.

PS: this is not just a random Tukkka. I did my preparations using this way, gave interviews at 4 places, and got an offer from all of these Alhamdulillah.

Bqi relax, have tawakal on Allah. InShaAllah Jo naseeb me likha hai wo mil k rhe ga or Jo jga ap k liea behtar hai wahi pe jana hai Apne at the end. Just keep doing tadbeer and then asking Duas. Jazak Allah."
